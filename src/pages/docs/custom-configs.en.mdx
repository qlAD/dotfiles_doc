# Custom configurations

There are two config files: `config/api.config.js` and `config/site.config.js`.

- `config/api.config.js` - is used to define your API endpoints and tokens. **OneDrive international users don't have to change anything.**
- `config/site.config.js` - is used for customising the website, such as the folder to share, the title, used Google fonts, site icons, contact info, etc.

## Configuring custom API settings

Only make changes here if you think you have to.

- If you are not the admin of your OneDrive account (which may happen to OneDrive business, educational or E5 subscription accounts), you may need to define your own `clientId` and `obfuscatedClientSecret`. More on this here [Using your own client id and secret](./advanced#using-your-own-clientid-and-clientsecret-1).
- If you are a OneDrive ‰∏ñÁ∫™‰∫íËÅî user, you should change `authApi` and `driveApi` (which you should have already done so in [Getting started - Modify API settings](./getting-started#modify-api-settings-optional-1)).

{/* you may also need to change `directLinkRegex` to use the proxied download functions. Check here [Proxied download (disabled)](todo). */}

## Customising your website

A couple of configurations are extracted for you to customise your site, these customisations live in `config/site.config.js`.

### `userPrincipalName`

You have already defined this in [Getting started](./getting-started#customise-site-settings) for the OAuth process.

### `icon` - Icons and favicons

![Customising your site's icons and favicons]( ./_images/custom-configs/customising-icons.png)

`icon` - is the website icon to the left of the title inside the navigation bar. **It should be placed under the [`/public`](https://github.com/spencerwooo/onedrive-vercel-index/tree/main/public) directory of your GitHub project (not your OneDrive folder!)**, and referenced here by its relative path to `/public`.

For example, if your onedrive-vercel-index's GitHub project's `/public` directory holds:

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ favicon-16x16.png
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ favicon-32x32.png
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ favicon.ico
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ icons
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 64.png
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

And say you want to use `64.png` as your website's icon, then you should change `icon` in `site.config.js` to `/icons/64.png`, and you should be good to go. The favicons of your website should also be placed here under `/public` directly, you can use [favicon.io](http://favicon.io) to generate favicons with your image, and replace the favicons set in the main project.

### `title` - Site title

The name of your website. Present alongside your icon.

### `baseDirectory`

The folder that you are to share publicly with onedrive-vercel-index. You should have already defined this.

### `maxItems`

`maxItems` - represents the maximum number of items that one directory lists, pagination supported. This is limited up to 200 items by the upstream OneDrive API.

  Try pagination here: [https://drive.swo.moe/ü•ü Some test
  files/Imagenette](https://drive.swo.moe/%F0%9F%A5%9F%20Some%20test%20files/Imagenette).

### `googleFont` - Custom font family

We use Google Font natively for font customisations.

- `googleFontSans` - the sans serif font used in onedrive-vercel-index.
- `googleFontMono` - the monospace font used in onedrive-vercel-index.
- `googleFontLinks` - an array of links for referencing the google font assets.

You can check and generate the required links and names at [fonts.google.com](https://fonts.google.com/).

### `footer`

The footer component of your website. You can write HTML here, but you need to escape double quotes - changing `"` to `\"`. You can write anything here, and if you like badges, generate some with [shields.io](http://shields.io) üòÉ

### `protectedRoutes`

This is where you specify the folders that are password protected. It is an array of paths pointing to all the directories in which you have `.password` set. More on this in [Password protected folders](./features/protected-folders).

### `email`

`email` - is optional, and can be removed should you wish - by only leaving a `""` here.

```diff
- "email": "mailto:spencer.wushangbo@gmail.com",
+ "email": "",
```

However, I suggest adding some form of contact for your website.

### `links`

`links` - is an array of `{ "name": "xxx", "link": "xxx" }`. In the latest update, all brand icons inside Font Awesome is supported and the icon to render is based on the `name` you provide. See the demo screen recording below.

### `datetimeFormat`

`datetimeFormat` - is a [`day.js`](https://day.js.org/)-style datetime format string to format datetimes in the app. Detailed specification can be found in [`day.js` Docs](https://day.js.org/docs/en/display/format).

The default value is [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) full datetime without timezone and replacing character `T` with space, which looks like `2006-01-02 15:04:05`. Here are some other provided `day.js` format strings if you do not want to refer to its documentation and build them on your own:

- `new Date().toLocaleString('en-US')`: `M/D/YYYY, h:mm:ss A`, which looks like `1/2/2006, 3:04:05 PM`.
- `new Date().toLocaleString('en-GB')`: `DD/MM/YYYY, HH:mm:ss`, which looks like `2/1/2006, 15:04:05`.
- `new Date().toLocaleString('zh-cn')` replacing ‰∏ä/‰∏ãÂçà with A/PM: `YYYY/M/D A h:mm:ss`, which looks like `2006/1/2 PM 3:04:05`.
