# Multi-file and folder download

<Callout emoji="⚠️" type="warning">
  This may be slow in reality. I would suggest using it for only downloading a batch of small files in large quantities,
  instead of a couple of large files.

We use JSZip to download all files in-browser and compress them into file blobs, which are then downloaded to your device as a `zip` file.

This is extremely useful if a series of small files are to be downloaded, but it could be time consuming if used for bulk-downloading a few large files.

Folders are traversed and recursively fetched into the compressed zip. Multiple files or folders can be selected and downloaded side-by-side.
