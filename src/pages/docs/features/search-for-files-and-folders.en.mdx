# Search for files and folders

Native search is now supported! Use `Ctrl` or `âŒ˜ + K` to open the search box, and `ESC` to close.

## Caveats

- Limited support as the search provided by Microsoft Graph API is not ideal.
- Extremely limited support for CJK search.

## Security concerns

Besides caveats above:

- **Search results still include your protected directories**
- This means your **file names** (whether inside the protected folder or not) are exposed.
- Visitors still need to enter passwords if they want to access the protected file contents.
