# Updating to the latest version

Basically, you are syncing a fork of a repository to keep your repository up-to-date with my upstream repository. So, check out [GitHub - Syncing a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork).

## From the Web UI

- On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the forked repository that you want to sync with the upstream repository.
- Select the Fetch upstream drop-down.
- Review the details about the commits from the upstream repository, then click Fetch and merge.
- If the changes from the upstream repository cause conflicts, GitHub will prompt you to create a pull request to resolve the conflicts.

## Command line

Clone the forked repo locally and:

```bash
# Fetch upstream changes
git fetch upstream

# Checkout your fork's local default branch - main
git checkout main

# Merge upstream changes into your fork
git merge upstream/main

# If there are conflicts - manually resolve them locally
# Commit changes and push to GitHub
git commit -m "xxx"
git push
```
