Some of the more advanced configurations here. You may or may not be looking for them.

## Using your own `clientId` and `clientSecret`

If you are not the admin of your OneDrive account, you may not be able to use the project's `clientId` and `clientSecret` provided by me. In this case, you would need to generate your own client id and secret for authentication.

### Register a new application

Open the following link:

- [Microsoft Azure App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade) (for OneDrive international, OneDrive for Business or Education), or...
- [Microsoft Azure.cn App registrations](https://portal.azure.cn/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade) (OneDrive 世纪互联版本)

Create a new blade app:

1. Login with your Microsoft account, select _New registration_.
2. Enter the _Name_ for your blade app, `my-onedrive-vercel-index` for example.
3. Set _Supported account types_ to:

   ```
   Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)
   ```

   OneDrive 世纪互联用户设置为 - 任何组织目录（任何 Azure AD 目录 - 多租户）中的帐户.

4. Set _Redirect URI (optional)_ to `Web` (the multiselect dropdown) and `http://localhost` (the URL).
5. Click Register.

### Get your client id and secret

Your Application (client) ID is the `clientId` to appear in your `api.config.js`. It should be present at _Overview_ > _Essentials_.

![Your application (client) ID](./_images/advanced/get-client-id.png)

Your client secret needs to be generated manually:

1. Open _Certificates & secrets panel_.
2. Click _New client secret_.
3. Create a new secret with description `client_secret`.
4. Set _Expires_ to `Custom`.
5. Change _Start_ and _End_ to the longest available time duration available.

Finally, click _Add_, and copy the Value of the client_secret (You only have this one chance to copy it).

### Modify API permissions

Microsoft Graph API comes with API permission scopes. Our project only requires the following (which are defined in `api.config.js`):

```
user.read files.read.all offline_access
```

Open _API permissions_, select _Microsoft Graph_, select _Delegated permissions_, and search for:

- User.Read (this should already be available)
- Files.Read.All
- offline_access

Select all three of them and click _Add permissions_.

<Callout>At this point, you should have your `clientId` and `clientSecret` ready.</Callout>

### Modify configs in `api.config.js`

You can directly replace `clientId` with your generated `clientId`.

However, client secret is more involved. You need to obfuscate it with AES encryption.

<Encryption />

You should get an obfuscated client secret which looks like:

```
U2FsdGVkX1830zo3/pFDqaBCVBb37iLw3WnBDWGF9GIB2f4apzv0roemp8Y+iIxI3Ih5ecyukqELQEGzZlYiWg==
```

Replace the `obfuscatedClientSecret` with this value.

If you changed `redirectUri` to something other than `http://localhost`, you need to change that in `api.config.js` as well.
