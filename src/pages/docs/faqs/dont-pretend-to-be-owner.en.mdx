![Do not pretend to be the site owner](../_images/faqs/dont-pretend-to-be-site-owner.png)

It is because we need to verify if **you** are really **you** before saving the actual tokens into your database. If you see this, **then the email you defined in `site.config.js` under `userPrincipalName` is wrong.**

You must configure this email to be **exactly the same** as the one you use to log into your Microsoft account during the second step of OAuth. Check for typos, domain names, and incorrect capitalisations. **Must be exactly the same!** ðŸ˜¡
